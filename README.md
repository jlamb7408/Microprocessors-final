This repository contains my final project for my class on Microprocessors. In this project I created a snake game using a nucleo board, SPI display, and external interrupts.
The code used for this project can be found in the main.c file.
For more details about this project, I've incldued the project report pdf which I created using LaTex.
The LaTex files can also be found here.
